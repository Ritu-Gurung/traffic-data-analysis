# traffic-data-analysis
A Python application for analyzing and visualizing urban traffic patterns from time-series data. This project demonstrates data processing, analysis and visualization skills relevant to data analytics roles.
Overview
This system processes traffic sensor data to extract key insights about vehicle distribution, peak traffic hours, speed compliance and junction comparison. It was developed as part of academic coursework and expanded to showcase practical data analysis skills.
Features
•	Data Processing: Cleans and processes CSV traffic datasets with multiple vehicle types
•	Key Metrics Calculation:
o	Peak traffic hours
o	Vehicle type distribution
o	Speed limit violations
o	Weather impact analysis
o	Junction comparison metrics
•	Automated Reporting: Generates structured text reports with all calculated metrics
•	Data Visualization: Creates comparative histograms showing vehicle frequency by hour across two junctions
•	User Interaction: Interactive console interface for date selection and analysis
 Technologies Used
•	Python 3.x
•	Custom data processing algorithms
•	File I/O operations for data handling
•	Basic graphics library for visualization
